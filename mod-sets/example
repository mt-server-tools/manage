#MTMODLIST -- this first line MUST have the string MTMODLIST somewhere in it
# Line format is GITURL [internal_path]
# a '#' indicates a comment line
# comments must be on their own lines

# Example: the travelnet mod
# The github repo itself is the mod folder, so we don't specify any mods after the URL
https://github.com/Sokomine/travelnet

# Example: the 3d-armor mod
# The github repo actually houses multiple mods, we specify in a space-separated list which ones we want to use
# these are the neames of the mod directories directly under the github repo
