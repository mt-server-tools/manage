# Installing a Minetest Server

## The Quickstart Guide with `mt-manage`

First things you will need to do:

* Get hosting
	* There's some notes in [the providers file](providers.md)
	* You can also ask someone else to provide some space for you on the Minetest Forums
	* To use `mt-manage` ensure you are on Ubuntu 16.04 or later, and have SSH access and root permissions
* Get a domain name, or subdomain
	* Buy a domain name at namecheap for example
	* Or get a dynamic DNS name at DuckDNS
	* this allows your IP to change without breaking peoples' Favourites/bookmarked servers

Once you have these, and you are pointing your (sub-) domain at the server's IP, it's time to install

### Set up firewall and SSH security

	adduser myuser # use a strong, long passphrase
	gpasswd -a myuser sudo
	sed -r 's/#?PermitRootLogin.+/PermitRootLogin no/' -i /etc/ssh/sshd.config
	ufw allow OpenSSH
	ufw activate

You should now be logging in as `myuser` (or whatever user name you specified), and use `sudo su` to gain a root session.

### Install tools

	apt update && apt install git -y
	git clone https://github.com/taikedz/mt-manage
	cd mt-manage
	bin/install-minetest

### Configure your server settings

	bin/mt-config -a AdminUsername -n "Server Name" -d "Server description. Make it catchy!" -h "server.host.name"
	bin/mt-config --pvp true --damage true
	ufw allow 30000
	bin/mt-restart

See `bin/mt-config --help` for all available options.

You now have a bare-bones minetest server you can connect to and play on - but don't do that yet!

### Choose mods, or choose a mod set

To use a mod-set

	bin/mt-installmods $MODSETFILE

There are example mod set files in [mod-sets](../mod-sets)

For example:

	bin/mt-installmods mod-sets/adventure mod-sets/multiplayer


To install individual mods from `mogray5`'s mods repository

	apt-cache search minetest $MODNAME

Then use `apt-get install $PKG` to install the appropriate package

#### Activate mods

Activate ALL the mods.

	systemctl restart minetest-server
	sed -r 's/^(load_mod.+)false$/\1true/' -i /var/games/minetest-server/.minetest/worlds/world/world.mt
	bin/mt-restart

### Choose a spawn point

This is optional. You can now log in to your server as your admin user and navigate around the world, build things, create a spawn hut if you want. Find the coordinates (use `F5` in-game to display stats) of the spawn point you want for all users and then run this command in the SSH session:

	bin/mt-config --set-spawn "$X, $Y, $Z"

Replace X, Y and Z as appropriate, remember to use the double-quotes.

Restart the service

	bin/mt-restart

### Give initial items

Change the intial items given, activate giving, and restart the server

	bin/mt-gives
	bin/mt-config --give-initial true
	bin/mt-restart

## Go Live!

You can advertise your server on the main minetest list now!

	bin/mt-config -b true
	bin/mt-restart

If you want, create an entry in [the Servers section of the forums](https://forum.minetest.net/viewforum.php?f=10) to talk about your server!

## Troubleshooting

For client-side issues, run `minetest` from the command line and check the output log, or check the `~/.minetest/debug.txt` for details

For server-side issues, you can check the text log at `/var/log/minetest/minetest.log` or use `journalctl -xe -u minetest-server` for the system log

### Monitoring

To monitor resources live, use htop

	apt update && apt install htop
	htop

To monitor chat whilst not connected to the game, execute the following on the server

	tail -f /var/log/minetest.log | grep CHAT

To monitor players connecting and disconnecting

	tail -f /var/log/minetest.log | grep "List of players:"

### Resetting the world

You can backup; and reset world data (creates a new world, deletes players)

	bin/mt-drastic entomb # makes a backup
	bin/mt-drastic exorcise # reset

You can also restore a previously backed up game; this automatically creates a backup of the existing game.

	bin/mt-drastic exhume ARCHIVEFILE

## Updating

Update the system, and any mods installed from APT repository:

	apt update && apt upgrade

Update all mods from mod-set: run the same mod set install as before

	`bin/mt-installmods $MODSETFILE`

Now restart minetest service:

	bin/mt-restart
